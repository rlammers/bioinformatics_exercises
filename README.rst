Bioinformatics Exercises
========================

I will post my solutions to the exercises from http://rosalind.info/problems.

Some of the exercises were completed prior to creating the repository, I will add the code I used to solve those problems later if I find them.

I welcome pull requests which improve on the solutions I have proposed.

I will be using Python 3.4 for the majority of the exercises.
